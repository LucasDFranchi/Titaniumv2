# Titaniumv2 - IoT Operating System for ESP32

Titaniumv2 is an open-source operating system designed to bring a Linux-like experience to IoT devices using the ESP32 IDF. Built on top of the ESP32 IoT Development Framework, this project aims to provide a robust and efficient environment for running applications on resource-constrained IoT hardware.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Titaniumv2 supports multitasking and efficient task scheduling, allowing IoT devices to run multiple applications concurrently.

- **Memory Optimization**: The operating system is designed to manage system memory efficiently, optimizing performance for IoT use cases.

- **Peripheral Access**: Titaniumv2 provides an abstraction layer for interacting with peripherals, making it easier to develop applications that use sensors, actuators, and other hardware components.

- **Networking**: Incorporate networking capabilities to facilitate communication between IoT devices, enabling seamless data exchange in IoT ecosystems.

- **File System**: Titaniumv2 includes a simplified file system abstraction tailored for IoT devices, making it convenient to read and write data to non-volatile storage.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up Titaniumv2 on your ESP32 device:

1. Clone the Titaniumv2 repository:
   ```bash
